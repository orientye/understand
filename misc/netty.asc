=== 特点
参考: https://netty.io/index.html

netty5.0已经废弃:
主要原因: The major change of using a ForkJoinPool increases complexity and has not
demonstrated a clear performance benefit. Also keeping all the branches in sync is quite some work without a real need for it as there is nothin in current master which I think justifies a new major release.
