=== 介绍
Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes, and most modern operating systems treat threads, not processes, as the basic units of scheduling.

Benefits of threads:
1. Exploiting multiple processors
2. Simplicity of modeling
A complicated, asynchronous workflow can be decomposed into a number of simpler, synchronous workflows each running in a separate thread, interacting only with each other at specific synchronization points.
3. Simplified handling of asynchronous events
4. More responsive user interfaces
