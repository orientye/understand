=== 介绍
Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes, and most modern operating systems treat threads, not processes, as the basic units of scheduling.

Benefits of threads:
1. Exploiting multiple processors
2. Simplicity of modeling
A complicated, asynchronous workflow can be decomposed into a number of simpler, synchronous workflows each running in a separate thread, interacting only with each other at specific synchronization points.
3. Simplified handling of asynchronous events
4. More responsive user interfaces

Risks of threads:
1. Safety hazards
Thread safety can be unexpectedly subtle because, in the absence of sufficient
synchronization, the ordering of operations in multiple threads is unpredictable
and sometimes surprising.
2. Liveness hazards
safety means "nothing bad ever happens"
liveness concerns the complementary goal that "something good eventually happens"
For example, if thread A is waiting for a resource that thread B holds exclusively, and B never releases it, A will wait forever.
3. Performance hazards
When threads share data, they must use synchronization mechanisms that can inhibit
compiler optimizations, flush or invalidate memory caches, and create synchronization traffic on the shared memory bus. All these factors introduce additional performance costs.

Threads are everywhere:
When the JVM starts, it creates threads for JVM housekeeping tasks (garbage collection, finalization) and a main thread for running the main method.
The AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing user interface frameworks create threads for managing user interface events.
Timer creates threads for executing deferred tasks.
Component frameworks, such as servlets and RMI create pools of threads and invoke component methods in these threads.
