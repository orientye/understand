=== memory model
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_model_(programming)

- Most research in the area of memory models revolves around:
** Designing a memory model that allows a maximal degree of freedom for compiler optimizations while still giving sufficient guarantees about race-free and (perhaps more importantly) race-containing programs.
** Proving program optimizations that are correct with respect to such a memory model.
