== lua脚本

=== 背景
If this had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. Lua was chosen based on the implementation requirements, not on the language ones... (small, fast, ANSI-C). I appreciate certain ideas in Lua, and people love it, but I was never able to like Lua, because it departs from a more Algol-like syntax and semantics without good reasons, for my taste. This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it's part of how the languages are different. But I think for Lua this is not true enough: it feels like it departs from what people know without good reasons. --- antirez (December 2025)

=== 作用

    ▪ 原子操作: 脚本作为一个整体执行
    ▪ 降低网络开销: 多条命令一次打包
    ▪ 重复使用: lua脚本能存放到redis服务器, 每次脚本的执行只需传入脚本唯一id就能执行该脚本
