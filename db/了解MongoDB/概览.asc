- 优点

        文档数据模型
                Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.
                Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.
                Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

        高性能
                Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.
                Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.

        高可用
                MongoDB’s replication facility, called replica set, provides: automatic failover, data redundancy. 
                A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and increasing data availability.

        水平扩展
                Sharding

        Rich Query Language
                Data Aggregation
                Text Search and Geospatial Queries.
  
        Support for Multiple Storage Engines
                WiredTiger Storage Engine
                In-Memory Storage Engine

- 缺点

        早期缺乏事务支持, now性能？
        
        缺乏对数据的约束
        
        OLAP缺乏支持? now?

        复杂join?
