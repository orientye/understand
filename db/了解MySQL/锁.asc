== 锁
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking.html

=== 全局锁
- 对整个数据库实例加锁
- 命令: flush tables with read lock(FTWRL)
- 典型使用场景

    全库逻辑备份，也就是把整库每个表都select出来存成文本    
    缺点：如果是主库备份，业务基本停摆；如果是从库备份，主从延迟；
    正确姿势：mysqldump --single-transaction(过程中也用到FTWRL)

=== 表锁

●  两种：表锁，元数据锁（metal data lock, MDL）

        tips：MDL not DML --- DDL is Data Definition Language : it is used to define data structures.For example, with SQL, 
it would be instructions such as create table, alter table, ...; DML is Data Manipulation Language : it is used to manipulate 
data itself.For example, with SQL, it would be instructions such as insert, update, delete, ...

●  表锁

新类事务的提交语句

命令: lock tables … read/write
数据更新语句（增删改），数据定义语句（建表，修改表结构等）和更

unlock tables主动释放或客户端断开时自动释放
对于innodb, 不推荐使用，影响面太大，改成begin和commit;
对于MyISAM等，安排升级换引擎

●  MDL无需显式使用

对表做增删改查，加MDL读锁
对表结构变更操作，加MDL写锁
事务的MDL锁，在语句执行开始时申请，会等到整个事务提交后再释放

=== 意向锁（Intension Locks）

● InnoDB supports multiple granularity locking which permits coexistence of row locks and table locks 

● intention shared lock (IS) 
 	indicates that a transaction intends to set a shared lock on individual rows in a table

● intention exclusive lock (IX) 
 	indicates that that a transaction intends to set an exclusive lock on individual rows in a table

● For example, SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE sets an IS lock, and SELECT ... FOR UPDATE sets an IX lock.

● Before a transaction can acquire a shared lock on a row in a table, it must first acquire an IS lock or stronger on the table. Before a transaction can acquire an exclusive lock on a row in a table, it must first acquire an IX lock on the table.

● Intention locks do not block anything except full table requests (for example, LOCK TABLES ... WRITE). The main purpose of intention locks is to show that someone is locking a row, or going to lock a row in the table.

● why
为了控制在一个事务锁表之后,其他事务的「锁行」行为,所以设置这么一道“关卡”————每个事务获取行锁时都要先获取对应的意向锁.

每个事务在尝试获取自己需要的行锁时, 会先通过意图锁检查一下表锁的占用情况,再决定是否继续获得行锁,具体判断规则:如果表X锁被占有,则其他事务尝试获得 IS、IX均会阻塞,也就不能继续获取行X锁或行S锁了.如果表S锁被占有,则其他事务可以获得IS, 而获得IX会阻塞. 从而阻止其他事务获得行X锁。

=== 行锁(record lock)
- 共享锁/读锁 shared (S) lock

        permits the transaction that holds the lock to read a row.

- 排它锁/写锁 exclusive (X) lock
        
        permits the transaction that holds the lock to update or delete a row.

=== Gap Lock & Next-key Lock 

● >=RR

●  Next-Key Lock = Gap Lock + Record Lock 前开后闭

●  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE), UPDATE, and DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition, or a range-type search condition. For a unique index with a unique search condition, InnoDB locks only the index record found, not the gap before it. For other search conditions, InnoDB locks the index range scanned, using gap locks or next-key locks to block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the range.

●  作用：解决幻读

=== Insert Intension Lock

●  An insert intention lock is a type of gap lock set by INSERT operations prior to row insertion

●  This lock signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they are not inserting at the same position within the gap. Suppose that there are index records with values of 4 and 7. Separate transactions that attempt to insert values of 5 and 6, respectively, each lock the gap between 4 and 7 with insert intention locks prior to obtaining the exclusive lock on the inserted row, but do not block each other because the rows are nonconflicting.

=== AUTO-INC Locks
● An AUTO-INC lock is a special table-level lock taken by transactions inserting into tables with AUTO_INCREMENT columns. In the simplest case, if one transaction is inserting values into the table, any other transactions must wait to do their own inserts into that table, so that rows inserted by the first transaction receive consecutive primary key values.

The innodb_autoinc_lock_mode configuration option controls the algorithm used for auto-increment locking. It allows you to choose how to trade off between predictable sequences of auto-increment values and maximum concurrency for insert operations.

=== 其他
●  悲观锁与乐观锁

=== 分析
●  事务的隔离级别？
●  是否为主键？
●  如果不是主键，那么id列上有索引吗？
●  如果有二级索引，那么这个索引是唯一索引吗？
●  主键扫描？唯一键扫描？范围扫描？全表扫描？

=== 死锁
●  超时机制
●  wait-for graph检测机制
●  innodb并不会回滚大部分的错误异常，但死锁除外
