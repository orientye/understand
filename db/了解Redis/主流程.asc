== 主流程
=== 线程
- v4.0
which introduced multithreading for asynchronous tasks

- v6.0
formally implements I/O multithreading in the network model

- 主要思想
Multi-threaded network I/O using I/O threads, where I/O threads are only responsible for network I/O and command parsing, and do not execute client commands.
Implement a lock-free multi-threaded model using atomic operations + interleaved access.
Isolating the main process from other sub-processes by setting CPU affinity, so that the multi-threaded network model can maximize performance.
