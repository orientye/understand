    There are around 100 threads procedures, all prefixed pthread_ and they can be categorized into four groups:

    (1)Thread management - creating, joining threads etc.
    (2)Mutexes
    (3)Condition variables
    (4)Synchronization between threads using read/write locks and barriers

    The POSIX semaphore API works with POSIX threads but is not part of threads standard, having been defined in the POSIX.1b, Real-time extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993) standard. Consequently, the semaphore procedures are prefixed by sem_ instead of pthread_.
