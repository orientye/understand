=== join and detach

- Join

    If a thread is not detached , then we must join with it using pthread_join(). If we fail to do this, then, when the thread terminates, it produces the thread equivalent of a zombie process. Aside from wasting system resources, if enough thread zombies accumulate, we won’t be able to create additional threads. 

- Detach

    Detaching a thread doesn’t make it immune to a call to exit() in another thread or a return in the main thread. In such an event, all threads in the process are imme-diately terminated, regardless of whether they are joinable or detached. To put things another way, pthread_detach() simply controls what happens after a thread terminates, not how or when it terminates.
