=== implementation
●  Linux Threads(已废弃), NTPL(now)

● Thread Implementation Models

    how threads are mapped onto kernel scheduling entities (KSEs):
    Many-to-one (M:1) implementations (user-level threads)
    One-to-one (1:1) implementations (kernel-level threads)
    Many-to-many (M:N) implementations (two-level model)
    Both of the Linux threading implementations—LinuxThreads and NPTL—employ the 1:1 model.

●  thread-stack

    Four threads executing in a process (Linux/x86-32)

Q: 线程堆栈默认大小？
per-thread-size默认大小: 8MB(x86-32) ？ 32MB(IA64)？
