Thread-Specific Data  vs. Thread-Local Storage

The pthread_key_create and friends are much older, and thus supported on more systems.

The __thread is a relative newcomer, is generally much more convenient to use, and (according to Wikipedia) is supported on most POSIX systems that still matter: Solaris Studio C/C++, IBM XL C/C++, GNU C, Clang and Intel C++ Compiler (Linux systems).

The __thread also has a significant advantage that it is usable from signal handlers (with the exception of using __thread from dlopened shared library, see this bug), because its use does not involve malloc (with the same exception).
