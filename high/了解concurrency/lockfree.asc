=== wait free

- Wait-Free definition: Each operation completes in a finite number of steps
- Wait-free implies lock-free
- Lock-free algorithms does not imply wait-free

    Note while loops in our lock-free algorithms…

- Wait-free synchronization much harder

    Impossible in many cases
    Usually specifiable only given a fixed number of threads

- Generally appear only in ‘hard’ real time systems

=== implement

- With few exceptions, non-blocking algorithms use atomic read-modify-write primitives that the hardware must provide, the most notable of which is compare and swap (CAS). 

- Additionally, some non-blocking data structures are weak enough to be implemented without special atomic primitives. These exceptions include:

        ● a single-reader single-writer ring buffer FIFO, with a size which evenly divides 
the overflow of one of the available unsigned integer types, can unconditionally be 
implemented safely using only a memory barrier
        ● Read-copy-update with a single writer and any number of readers. (The readers 
are wait-free; the writer is usually lock-free, until it needs to reclaim memory).
        ● Read-copy-update with multiple writers and any number of readers. (The 
readers are wait-free; multiple writers generally serialize with a lock and are not 
obstruction-free).
