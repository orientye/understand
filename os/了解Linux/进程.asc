=== 终止
exit, _exit
The following actions are performed by exit():
Exit handlers (functions registered with atexit() and on_exit()) are called, in reverse order of their registration.
The stdio stream buffers are flushed.
The _exit() system call is invoked, using the value supplied in status.
Unlike _exit(), which is UNIX-specific, exit() is defined as part of the standard C library; that is, it is available with every C implementation.

=== 状态
执行man ps命令:
PROCESS STATE CODES

    Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process:
        D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
        I    Idle kernel thread
        R    running or runnable (on run queue)
        S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
        T    stopped by job control signal
        t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
        W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
        X    dead (should never be seen)
        Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

    For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:
        <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
        N    low-priority (nice to other users)
        L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
        s    is a session leader
        l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
        +    is in the foreground process group

==== IPC-pipe
byte stream; unidirectional;
Writes of up to PIPE_BUF bytes are guaranteed to be atomic
Pipes have a limited capacity(linux2.6.11, 65536bytes default,fcntl(fd, F_SETPIPE_SZ, size) )

int pipe(int filedes[2]);

Q: 匿名管道支持非阻塞读写吗？

注意事项：
When using pipes, we must be careful to close unused descriptors in order to ensure that reading processes detect end-of-file and writing processes receive the SIGPIPE signal or the EPIPE error. (Usually, it is easiest to have the application writing to a pipe ignore SIGPIPE and detect a “broken” pipe via the EPIPE error.)

int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

==== IPC-FIFO
By default, opening a FIFO for reading blocks until another process opens the FIFO for writing, and vice versa.

Nonblocking I/O 

==== IPC-System V

==== IPC-POSIX

==== IPC-File Lock
• Only fcntl() locking is standardized in SUSv3. 
• The flock() system call locks an entire file. 
• The fcntl() system call places locks (“record locks”) on any region of a file, ranging from a single byte to the entire file. Two types of locks may be placed: read locks and write locks, which have similar compatibility semantics to the shared and exclusive locks 
placed via flock(). If a blocking (F_SETLKW) lock request would bring about a deadlock situation, then the kernel causes fcntl() to fail (with the error EDEADLK) in one of the affected processes. 
• Locks placed using flock() and fcntl() are invisible to one another (except on systems that implement flock() using fcntl()). The locks placed via flock() and fcntl() have different semantics with respect to inheritance across fork() and release when file descriptors are 
closed. 
• The Linux-specific /proc/locks file displays the file locks currently held by all processes on the system.
